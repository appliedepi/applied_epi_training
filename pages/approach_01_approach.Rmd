## Our pedagogical approach {.unnumbered}

Applied Epi training materials are constructed with the following principles:  

### We are focused on frontline practitioners {.unnumbered}  

Our efforts are focused on improving the lives of ground-level public health practitioners and applied epidemiologists - the vast workforce at local and national health agencies, NGOs, and healthcare systems.  

While complex causal modeling and machine-learning algorithms have a role to play, we believe that most actionable public health intelligence derives from the frontline workforce. They have the most to benefit from R adoption, and their needs have historically been underserved by R developers.  

Therefore, our course content focus on the tasks, visualizations, and analyses most common in practical, applied epidemiology and public health.  



### We are curators on your behalf  {.unnumbered} 

We have leveraged our decades of experience using R and working in frontline epidemiology in order to *distill the vast universe of R packages and functions into the most easy and relevant approaches for beginners in public health practice*.  

R is notorious for having many ways to do the same thing. We've reviewed the options, and have chosen the easiest and best ones for you.  



### Thoughtful and deliberate curriculum {.unnumbered} 

We are intentional with our vocabulary, choice of terms, methodological consistency, and the progression of skills that we introduce (to reduce your mental load and speed up learning).  


### Building confidence to "tinker"  {.unnumbered}

The best (perhaps only) way to learn a new language like R is to "tinker", or to experiment and learn via trial and error. We build this into our courses by progressively encouraging you to write original code and understand R documentation and error messages.  


### Setting you up to actually use R  {.unnumbered}

Some R courses have you work only in a virtual environment, because it is less hassle for their instructors.  

In our live courses, we embrace the challenges of setting up R on *your computer*. This means dedicating time to work through the complications posed by employer security restrictions, other software such as OneDrive, VPNs, and previous R installations.  

Our self-paced tutorials are intended for larger audiences and cannot include the personal attention to troubleshoot R setup on your computer. Nevertheless, we focus on building coding skills within the tutorial, address R setup when possible, and offer "office hours" sessions for assistance.
