<details markdown=1><summary markdown="span" style='text-decoration: underline'>Install software</summary>  
  
Please be sure that you have the following software installed on your computer **prior to the start of the course**.  

Please work with your IT to install the following 3 software on your computer. The most important thing is that *you have administrator access to the software* and that they are *installed in locations away from any syncing software such as OneDrive - e.g. into the My Documents folder*.  

Please see this [installation guide](https://appliedepi.org/files/install_guide.pdf) for 

1) [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) (most recent version)
2) [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (most recent version)
3) [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (only needed for Windows machines)

After successful installation, please try to run [this R script](https://appliedepi.org/files/packages_to_install.R) called "packages_to_install.R" (see the end of the install guide for instructions). It will install most of the R packages that you need for this course.

<details markdown=1><summary markdown="span" style='text-decoration: underline'>Download course files</summary>  
  
Download the zipped course folder at [**this link**](https://appliedepi.org/files/intro_course.zip).  

**Unzip the folder and save it on your computer's desktop (not on a shared drive).** To "unzip" a folder once it is downloaded, right-click on the folder and select "Extract All". If offered a choice of location to save the unzipped folder, save it to your desktop.  

On your desktop:  

* `r emo::ji("folder")` intro_course  
     * `r emo::ji("folder")` data
          * `r emo::ji("folder")` clean  
          * `r emo::ji("folder")` raw  
          * `r emo::ji("folder")` pop  
          * `r emo::ji("folder")` shp  
     * `r emo::ji("folder")` scripts
     * `r emo::ji("folder")` outputs  
     * `r emo::ji("folder")` learning_materials  
          * `r emo::ji("folder")` covid_case_study  
          * `r emo::ji("folder")` backup_r_packages  
     * `r emo::ji("document")` surveillance_linelist_20141201.csv

`r emo::ji("warning")` You may also have some other files. Just leave them.

<details markdown=1><summary markdown="span" style='text-decoration: underline'>Create a new RStudio project</summary>  
  


1) Open RStudio. Ensure that you open *RStudio* and not just *R*.  

2) In RStudio click *File -> New Project*. In the pop-up window, select **"Existing directory"**.  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro_course_images/create_project.png")
```

3) Click "browse" and select the "intro_course" folder on your desktop, containing the course materials, which you downloaded earlier.  

4) Click "Create project"  

Voila! This will be the project for all of your work in this course.

<details markdown=1><summary markdown="span" style='text-decoration: underline'>Access the course exercises online</summary>  
  
The primary route to access the course exercises is online, via the links in the "Modules" section below. To access the exercises you will need to do the following:  

1) Use the link provided by your instructor to create a free account in our [Applied Epi Community](community.appliedepi.org) site. If you use the link from your instructor, you will automatically be added to the private group for your cohort.  

2) Use the links in the "Modules" section below to access the exercises. If they do not load immediately, be patient or try to refresh. If you see an error, ensure you are not on a VPN.  

If your internet connection is too weak to see the exercises, notify your instructor and follow the steps below to access the exercises *offline*.

<details markdown=1><summary markdown="span" style='text-decoration: underline'>Backup method to access the course offline</summary>  

The offline versions of the exercises are available in the folder "intro_course/learning_materials/backup_exercises/"

A further backup method is described below, but will require permissions from an instructor:

**Copy and paste this command into your R Console as shown below, then press the "Enter" key to run the command:**

>`remotes::install_github("appliedepi/introexercises", dep = TRUE, force = TRUE)`

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro_course_images/install_exercises.png")
```

Text will begin to appear in the Console, below the command. Do not worry, R is simply downloading the tutorials from the internet and printing updates. *Watch the print-out for any questions that R may ask you:*

  * If you encounter an error referencing HTTP or "proxy", then downloading from Github may be blocked by your institution. Proceed to the backup steps below.
  * If you see a printed warning about needing "RTools", do not worry. This is simply a warning message and the install should proceed without error.
  * If prompted to update some R packages, select "All" to update all of the packages. If you continue to be prompted for package updates, you can select "None" and continue without further updates.

**Backup option:**

**Go to the "Tools" menu of RStudio, and select "Install packages".**

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro_course_images/zip_tools_menu.png")
```

**In the pop-up window, select "zip" from the first drop-down menu.**

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro_course_images/zip_drop_down.png")
```

**Another window should appear to select a file (if not, select "Browse"). Navigate to the folder "Desktop/intro_courses/learning_materials/backup_r_packages".** Note the 8 zipped folders here - each one is an R package. Select the first one "basket", press "Open", then click "Install". R will run a brief command to install this package. **Repeat this step to install each of the 8 zipped folders.**

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro_course_images/zip_package_select.png")
```

If continuing to experience errors, you may need to restart R, and then run the following command:  

>`install.packages(c("tibble", "cli", "magrittr", "tidyr", "cli", "rlang", "tibble", "dplyr", "cachem", "fastmap"))`  

Your instructor can continue to troubleshoot with you. 

Now, the course exercises will appear *within your RStudio* offline. Each course module has a corresponding exercise, which can be accessed through the "Tutorials" pane in RStudio (upper-left). The gif below introduces you to the exercise environment (you do not need to follow the steps shown right now).  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro_course_images/exercise_demo_short_words.gif")
```

1) Click on the "Tutorial" tab in the upper-right RStudio pane (which also contains a tab holding your "Environment").  
  * Scroll down and review the listed exercises. If you do not see any "Applied Epi" exercises listed, close and re-open RStudio. They may take a minute to appear.  

2) Select the exercise, for example: "Applied Epi - R setup, syntax, data import"  
  * The exercise will load. Once you see the Applied Epi logo appear in the Tutorials pane, you can begin the exercise.  
  * To see the sidebar in the exercise, you may need to adjust the Tutorials pane to be wider. You can also adjust the zoom from the "View" menu.  
  * You can view the exercise in this pane, or click the small icon in the upper-left to pop-out into a separate window.
