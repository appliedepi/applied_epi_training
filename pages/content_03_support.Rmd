## Sustained support {.unnumbered} 

Our instructors *know* public health. One of the signature features of Applied Epi's training for organizations is that we provide follow-up support to your team, to help you apply your new skills to your work context.  

We schedule several 1.5-hour sessions with your team in the 3 months post-instruction. In these sessions, we help you troubleshoot code, advise you on analytical strategies, or guide you in new learning that you need.
