**Click on the text below to see instructions to access the tutorials offline**  


<details markdown=1><summary markdown="span" style='text-decoration: underline'>Access the course exercises offline</summary>  
  
**Copy and paste this command into your R Console as shown below, then press the "Enter" key to run the command:**

>`remotes::install_github("appliedepi/epitutorials", dep = TRUE, force = TRUE)`

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro_course_images/install_exercises.png")
```

Text will begin to appear in the Console, below the command. Do not worry, R is simply downloading the tutorials from the internet and printing updates. *Watch the print-out for any questions that R may ask you:*

  * If you encounter an error referencing HTTP or "proxy", then downloading from Github may be blocked by your institution.  
  * If you see a printed warning about needing "RTools", do not worry. This is simply a warning message and the install should proceed without error.
  * If prompted to update some R packages, select "All" to update all of the packages. If you continue to be prompted for package updates, you can select "None" and continue without further updates.


Now, the tutorials can be access *within your RStudio*, offline. Each tutorial can be accessed through the "Tutorials" pane in RStudio (upper-left). The gif below introduces you to the exercise environment (you do not need to follow the steps shown right now).  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro_course_images/exercise_demo_short_words.gif")
```

1) Click on the "Tutorial" tab in the upper-right RStudio pane (which also contains a tab holding your "Environment").  
  * Scroll down and review the listed exercises. If you do not see any "Applied Epi" exercises listed, close and re-open RStudio. They may take a minute to appear.  

2) Select the exercise, for example: "Applied Epi Tutorials - R Basics"  
  * The exercise will load. Once you see the Applied Epi logo appear in the Tutorials pane, you can begin the exercise.  
  * To see the sidebar in the exercise, you may need to adjust the Tutorials pane to be wider. You can also adjust the zoom from the "View" menu.  
  * You can view the tutorial in this pane, or click the small icon in the upper-left to pop-out into a separate window.
