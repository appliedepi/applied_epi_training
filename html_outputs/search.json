Along way, introduce core principles “tidy data”.data cleaning, teach core R functions handling data, including standardizing editing column names, de-duplicating filtering rows, selecting modifying columns, re-coding values, .Together, write sequence “pipes” clean linelist step--step clear, reproducible manner… dataset ready preliminary analysis!Slides: Tidy data data cleaningSlides: Tidy data data cleaningExercise: Cleaning dataExercise: Cleaning dataModule 3: Grouping data summary tablesInformative tables bedrock epidemiological public health practice. module introduce three tools produce tables summary statistics: {dplyr} flexibility, {janitor} speed, {gtsummary} beauty.Finally, explore {flextable}, can used customize tables produced approaches: adding colors highlights, saving tables Word, PNG, HTML, etc.Slides: Grouping summarizing dataSlides: Grouping summarizing dataExercise: Grouping data summary tablesExercise: Grouping data summary tablesModule 4: Data visualization {ggplot2}Using {ggplot2} package maximum effect depends upon understanding apply “grammar graphics” build plot layer--layer. tackle introducing syntax logically using public health examples - build upon previous knowledge construct informative colorful bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, box/violin plots, line plots.also teach write text labels automatically update refreshed data (useful epidemiological reports!), use colors colorblind-friendly, .Slides: Data visualization ggplot2Slides: Data visualization ggplot2Slides: Scales, themes, labelsSlides: Scales, themes, labelsExercise: Data visualization ggplot2Exercise: Data visualization ggplot2Module 5: Transforming data: joins, pivots, factorsPublic health analytics rarely involves just one data set, now practice joining data adding hospital, laboratory, case investigation data surveillance linelist. ingrain best practices conducting joins, prepare data transformations independently.second part module, address pivoting, R means transforming data “long” “wide” formats. particularly relevant public health, format distinct benefits.Along way, introduce uses “factor” class (R’s version ordered levels variable) constructing timeline visualization patients’ pathways surveillance/medical system.Slides: Joining dataSlides: Joining dataExercise: Joining dataExercise: Joining dataSlides: Pivoting dataSlides: Pivoting dataExercise: Pivoting dataExercise: Pivoting dataModule 6: Data visualization public healthIn second data visualization module encourage practice learning R independently reading function documentation (necessary skill leave class!). still support , give live coding demonstrations topics, usual.cover various ways define “epiweeks” using R, recommended approach including cheatsheet.tackle visualizations central descriptive epidemiology: intricacies crafting accurate epidemic curve, conveying patterns across three variables using heat plot, creating age/sex pyramids describe demographics. time, finish demonstration R’s GIS/geospatial capabilities.Exercise: Data visualization public healthExercise: Data visualization public healthGIS demo R script can found course folder : “intro_course/scripts/backup/5_gis_demo.R”GIS demo R script can found course folder : “intro_course/scripts/backup/5_gis_demo.R”instructor provide “cheatsheet” epidemic weeks making epicurvesYour instructor provide “cheatsheet” epidemic weeks making epicurvesModule 7: Reports R MarkdownIn module, take R code Ebola case study writing throughout course convert reproducible, automated report (e.g. Word, PDF, HTML, etc.).teach variations syntax produce documents update incoming data refreshed can used inform public health partners stakeholders.Live demonstration Instructor guideLive demonstration Instructor guideSlides: R Markdown routine reportsSlides: R Markdown routine reportsExercise: R MarkdownExercise: R MarkdownModule 8: Final Exercise, peer code review\nlast module, put skills test writing R Markdown report using new dataset - COVID-19 case linelist.Unlike Ebola case study, solution code available .
